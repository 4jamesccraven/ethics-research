# Social Implications of Computing Research
## Abstract
In the modern age of software development, it is easier than ever to share and
consume software written by anyone, anywhere in the world thanks to the
internet, and hosting services such as GitHub, GitLab, et cetera. In this day
and age it is more important than ever to be educated about the ins and outs of
open source software: its benefits, its dangers, and the precise terms of its
licensing. This paper intends to mitigate these concerns by providing an
overview of the history, philosophy, reality, and legality of FOSS development.
An in-depth discussion of the various licenses available along with their terms
of usage, role in the history of software development, and the reality of how
these projects are managed will provide readers with all that they need to
safely benefit from and contribute to the Free and Open Source Software
Community, both in private, public, and proprietary settings.

## Repository Contents
1. A presentation and a paper, available in PDF form [here](./pdfs)
2. The source code for the presentation and the paper founde
   [here](./presentation) and [here](./paper) respectively.
4. Additional [resources](#resources) for licensing code (and more!) on GitHub

## Compiling
PDFs of the compiled artifacts are available already, but if you would like to
compile from source, you can do so using the command `latexmk -pdf` in the root
directory of whichever material you want to compile, or by uploading the contents
to a service like [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com).
