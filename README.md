# Social Implications of Computing Research
## Abstract
In the modern age of software development, it is easier than ever to share
and consume software written by anyone, anywhere in the world thanks to the
internet, and hosting services such as GitHub, GitLab, et cetera. In this
situation it is the most important it has ever been to be educated about
the ins and outs of open source software: its benefits, its dangers, and
the precise terms of its licensing. This paper intends to mitigate these
concerns by providing an overview of the history, philosophy, reality, and
legality of FOSS development. An in-depth discussion of the various
licenses available and their terms of usage, their role in the history of
software development, and the reality of how these projects are managed
will provide readers with all that they need to safely benefit from and
contribute to the Free and Open Source Software Community, both in private,
public, and proprietary settings.
